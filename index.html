                      Like music, reading, travelling, eating, playing, trying new clothes
                      shoes and accessories, taking walks in the evening and so on. I am also
                      involved in Customer Relationship Management as well as Social Media 
                      Marketing and Management. I can be versatile you know 😃

                        <p class="px-3 fs-5 text-muted">
                           I have always loved coding since 2020, but consistency has been an
                           issue for me. Although, this year has been different. Since June, I 
                           had been able to learn and cover alot of things which has greatly intrigued my 
                           interest ❣️.
    
                           So far, I have learnt about positioning, media queries, flexbox, grid and even 
                           bootstrap as well as some basis of UI/UX designs. All this has been possible because
                           I have an amaging tutor, Angela Yu; who takes her time to simplify everything.
                           Though I'm yet to learn Javascript, but I know I will with consistency.

                      <h3>A Social Media Marketer and Manager</h3>
                      <p class="px-3 fs-5 text-muted">
                        Funny how I never knew anything about social media but was so fascinated with it. I also 
                        got interested with it because you can communicate with different people from different 
                        places with so little efforts and it would yield tangible results.

                        So I thought about working on my interests by taking courses on Social media Marketing
                        and Management via Udemy. I have covered a bit of it anyway, still undertaking the course.

                        I hope it yield good results in the future 🤓.

                      <p class="px-3 fs-5 text-muted">
                        I have a work experience as a customer relationship manager. I got to learn about sales
                        as well. In the process, I had met different kind of customers and also handled different
                        scenerios where I had to employ the skills of diplomacy.

                        To improve on my knowledge, I also decided to take courses on the CRM software - Salesforce.
                        I am 80% done with the course even though it sounds abstract.

                        But I know, I will get an opportunity to try my knowledge soon 🤗.
